# 🧠 Micro AI Roleplay

*A 5-minute AI role-play game to practice real-life communication, boundaries, and emotional intelligence.*

---

## ✨ What is this?

**Micro AI Roleplay** is a lightweight AI-powered role-play experience where users respond to realistic social and professional situations — and receive structured feedback on how they handled it.

Instead of generic advice, the AI:

* Plays a **persistent role**
* Pushes back like a real person would
* Evaluates responses across key human traits

The goal is simple:
**Practice difficult conversations in a safe, repeatable way.**

## 🎮 How the simulation works (MVP)

1. **Scenario**
   A realistic situation is presented

2. **Your Response**
   You reply naturally — no “perfect answer” required

3. **AI Pushback**
   The AI stays in character and challenges your response

4. **Hidden Evaluation**
   Your response is scored across selected traits

5. **Feedback**
   Short, game-style feedback (points + explanation)

## 🧩 Traits Evaluated (MVP)

To keep the system focused, the MVP uses **5 core traits**:

| Trait             | What it Measures                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Assertiveness     | Ability to say no without guilt |
| Empathy           | Acknowledging the other person  |
| Clarity           | Clear and direct communication  |
| Self-Respect      | Protecting personal boundaries  |
| Emotional Control | Staying calm under pressure     |

These traits are intentionally chosen to be useful in **both personal and professional life**.
